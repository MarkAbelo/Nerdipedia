        "Here's the thing. You said \"a Charizard is a dragon.\" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a Dragon type Gym Leader, I am telling you, specifically, in all of Kanto, no one calls Charizards dragons. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying \"dragon egg group\" you're referring to the entirebreeding group, which includes things from Charmander to Magikarp to Goomy. So your reasoning for calling a Charizard a dragon is because random people \"call the giant lizards dragons?\" Let's get Mega Gyarados and Aerodactyl in there, then, too. Also, calling someone an Indigo E4 or Kanto E4, It's not one or the other, that's not how the Indigo League works. They're both. A Charizard is a Charizard and a member of the dragon family. But that's not what you said. You said a Charizard is a dragon, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the dragon family dragons, which means you'd call Magikarp, Goomy, and Alolan Exeggutor dragons, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're talking about Mega Charizard X, you know?"
